# here is a partial answer that shows the directory names.
# ls -mR * | sed -n 's/://p'
# Explanation:

# ls -mR * lists the full directory names ending in a ':', then lists the files in that directory separately

# sed -n 's/://p' finds lines that end in a colon, strip off the colon and print the line

# By iterating over the list of directories, we should be able to find the directories as well. Still workin on it. It is a challenge to get the wildcards through xargs.

#ls  -AmR */s* | sed -n 's/://p'|wc -l
